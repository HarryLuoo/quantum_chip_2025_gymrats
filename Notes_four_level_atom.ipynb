    "# Exercise 1 - 0-1 Rabi Oscillations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Detailed Physics Description\n",
    "\n",
    "### System Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We are examining a **four-level atomic system** that models a neutral atom qubit used in quantum computing. The system consists of the following states:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **|0⟩**: Ground state (computational basis state)\n",
    "- **|1⟩**: Excited state (computational basis state)\n",
    "- **|r⟩**: Rydberg state (high-energy state enabling interactions between atoms)\n",
    "- **|d⟩**: Decay state (represents other hyperfine states resulting from decay)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Known Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Rabi Frequency for 0-1 Transition (Ω₀₁):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Ω₀₁(t) = 1 MHz** (constant)\n",
    "   - This parameter represents the strength of the coupling between states |0⟩ and |1⟩ due to an external laser field.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Decay Rate of the Rydberg State (γᵣ):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **γᵣ = 1 / (5 μs)**\n",
    "   - This is the rate at which the Rydberg state |r⟩ decays to lower energy states.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Branching Ratios (b<sub>jr</sub>):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **b₀ᵣ = 1/16** (probability of decaying from |r⟩ to |0⟩)\n",
    "   - **b₁ᵣ = 1/16** (probability of decaying from |r⟩ to |1⟩)\n",
    "   - **b<sub>d</sub>ᵣ = 7/8** (probability of decaying from |r⟩ to |d⟩)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Other Hamiltonian Parameters (all set to zero):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **δ₁(t) = 0** (detuning of the laser for the 0-1 transition)\n",
    "   - **Ωᵣ(t) = 0** (no coupling between |1⟩ and |r⟩)\n",
    "   - **Δᵣ(t) = 0** (detuning of the laser for the 1-r transition)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Initial State:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The atom starts in the ground state **|0⟩** at time **t = 0**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Are Solving For\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Determine the Time Evolution of State Populations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Compute the populations **P₀(t)**, **P₁(t)**, **P<sub>r</sub>(t)**, and **P<sub>d</sub>(t)** over a time span of **50 μs**.\n",
    "   - Analyze how these populations change due to the applied laser field and any decay processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Validate the Theoretical Rabi Oscillation Formula:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Compare the simulated population of state **|1⟩** with the theoretical prediction given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     P_1(t) = \\sin^2\\left( \\frac{\\Omega_{01} t}{2} \\right)\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   - This formula describes the ideal probability of finding the atom in state **|1⟩** as a function of time, assuming no decay.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How We Solve It\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Construct the Hamiltonian (H):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Given that only **Ω₀₁(t)** is non-zero, the Hamiltonian simplifies to:\n",
    "\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     H = \\frac{\\Omega_{01}}{2} \\left( |0⟩⟨1| + |1⟩⟨0| \\right)\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   - This represents coherent oscillations between states **|0⟩** and **|1⟩** driven by the laser.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Define the Collapse Operators (L<sub>j</sub>):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The collapse operators account for the decay of the Rydberg state **|r⟩** into the lower states:\n",
    "\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     L_j = \\sqrt{b_{jr} \\gamma_r} \\; |j⟩⟨r|, \\quad \\text{for } j = 0, 1, d\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   - These operators model the irreversible processes where **|r⟩** decays to **|0⟩**, **|1⟩**, or **|d⟩**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Set Up the Lindblad Master Equation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The time evolution of the density matrix **ρ(t)** is governed by:\n",
    "\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\frac{d}{dt} \\rho(t) = -i [H, \\rho(t)] + \\sum_{j} \\left( L_j \\rho(t) L_j^{\\dagger} - \\frac{1}{2} L_j^{\\dagger} L_j \\rho(t) - \\frac{1}{2} \\rho(t) L_j^{\\dagger} L_j \\right)\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The first term represents the unitary evolution due to the Hamiltonian, and the second term accounts for decay processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Numerical Solution Using QuTiP:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - We use QuTiP's `mesolve` function to numerically integrate the master equation.\n",
    "   - Inputs include:\n",
    "     - **Hamiltonian (H)**\n",
    "     - **Initial state (|0⟩)**\n",
    "     - **Time array (tlist)**\n",
    "     - **List of collapse operators ([L₀, L₁, L<sub>d</sub>])**\n",
    "     - **Observables (projectors onto each state)**\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Compute Observables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Define projectors to measure the populations:\n",
    "\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     P_j = |j⟩⟨j|, \\quad \\text{for } j = 0, 1, r, d\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The expectation values **⟨P<sub>j</sub>⟩** yield the probability of the atom being in state **|j⟩** at time **t**.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Perform the Simulation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Initialize the system in **|0⟩**.\n",
    "   - Run the simulation over the defined time range to obtain **⟨P<sub>j</sub>(t)⟩**.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Plot and Analyze Results:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Plot the populations **P₀(t)**, **P₁(t)**, **P<sub>r</sub>(t)**, and **P<sub>d</sub>(t)** as functions of time.\n",
    "   - Overlay the theoretical Rabi oscillation **P₁(t)** for comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis and Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Rabi Oscillations Between |0⟩ and |1⟩:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Under the resonant driving field, the atom oscillates between **|0⟩** and **|1⟩**.\n",
    "   - The theoretical population of **|1⟩** is:\n",
    "\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     P_1(t) = \\sin^2\\left( \\frac{\\Omega_{01} t}{2} \\right)\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Effect of Decay:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - In this setup, there is no direct coupling to the Rydberg state **|r⟩** (since **Ωᵣ(t) = 0**), so **|r⟩** remains unpopulated.\n",
    "   - Consequently, the decay processes involving **|r⟩** have negligible impact on the system dynamics.\n",
    "   - The populations of **|0⟩** and **|1⟩** should closely follow the ideal Rabi oscillations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Simulation Results:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The numerical solution should show **P₀(t)** and **P₁(t)** oscillating out of phase, with **P₀(t) + P₁(t) ≈ 1**.\n",
    "   - Populations **P<sub>r</sub>(t)** and **P<sub>d</sub>(t)** remain close to zero throughout the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Verification:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Comparing the simulated **P₁(t)** with the theoretical expression validates the correctness of the simulation.\n",
    "   - Any discrepancies are likely due to numerical errors or minimal influence from decay processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Constructed** the Hamiltonian representing coherent excitation between states **|0⟩** and **|1⟩**.\n",
    "- **Included** collapse operators to account for potential decay from **|r⟩**, even though **|r⟩** is not populated.\n",
    "- **Solved** the master equation numerically to obtain the time evolution of the system.\n",
    "- **Observed** that the populations **P₀(t)** and **P₁(t)** exhibit Rabi oscillations as predicted by theory.\n",
    "- **Confirmed** that decay processes have negligible impact in this scenario due to the lack of population in **|r⟩**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simulation reinforces our understanding of Rabi oscillations in a two-level system and sets the foundation for more complex scenarios involving decay and coupling to additional states.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explore scenarios where **Ωᵣ(t)** is non-zero to see the impact of coupling to the Rydberg state.\n",
    "- Investigate the effects of detuning (**δ₁(t) ≠ 0**) on the oscillation frequency and amplitude.\n",
    "- Extend the model to include multiple atoms and interactions such as the Rydberg blockade.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will simulate the 0-1 Rabi oscillations in a four-level neutral atom qubit system using QuTiP. You'll implement the Hamiltonian, define the collapse operators for decoherence, run the simulation, and plot the populations of each state over time.\n"
