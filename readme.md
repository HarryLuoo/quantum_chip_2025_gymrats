Winner project for Quantum + Chips 2025 summer school at University of Minnesota.

For this project we use `qutip` to simulate a 3 qubit system coupled under driving magnetic field, in which we observe "crosstalk". We further mitigate crosstalk phenomenologically using an additional compensation Hamiltonian.
